# Second-Year Dynamics Textbook

Active-learning textbook for second-year dynamics (classical mechanics), maintained here by **Quadrivium Press**.

## Fork notice

This repository is a **fork and MyST web edition** of the second-year dynamics textbook originally developed at Queen’s University for PHYS 206 and published under the Open Source Textbook Project:

- **Upstream source:** OSTP/dynamicsTextbook (the GitHub repository is no longer published). This edition is maintained at [QuadriviumPress/dynamicsTextbook](https://github.com/QuadriviumPress/dynamicsTextbook).

The scientific content, chapter structure, teaching design, notebooks, and videos originate there. Quadrivium Press converted the book into editable MyST Markdown for web publication and continues development in this repository.

**Any errors introduced by conversion, editing, formatting, or later changes are ours alone.** Please do not attribute mistakes in this edition to the original authors.

## Acknowledgments

We are grateful to everyone who built the original open textbook and shared it under an open license. Special thanks to **Lance Schonberg**, **Sarah Sadavoy**, and the broader team who developed and improved this resource for students—your work made this edition possible.

We also acknowledge **Cora Sleegers** and the other contributors credited in the upstream project. Thank you for the care that went into the text, figures, notebooks, and instructional videos.
