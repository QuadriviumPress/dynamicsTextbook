## 2.1 Universality of the Laws of Motion:

Classical mechanics describes how objects move. While this chapter is called *Newtonian* *Motion* after Sir Isaac Newton, it is important to recognize that Newton was not the first person to develop theories about the motion of objects. Physics is universal. Historically, physicists from all over the world also sought laws of motion hundreds to thousands of years before Newton.

::::{admonition} Early Laws of Motion

One of the earliest individuals to connect forces to changes in motion is the Persian scholar Abu ‘Alī ibn Sīnā (980-1037), known as Avicenna in Europe. Note the following translation from ibn Sīnā’s work and its similarity to Newton’s first law (the law of inertia) given in the next section:

“...[N]obody begins to move or comes to rest of itself” (Hecht 2015, p. 1)

## 2.2 Newton’s Three Laws of Motion:

Newton’s three laws of motion are a mathematical description connecting motion to forces. These laws apply to all objects of any size (above the atomic level), any shape, and any internal structure (solid or even liquid). The three laws are:

<!-- Source PDF page 39; printed label 30. -->

1. **The law of inertia**: A body moves with constant velocity unless acted on by a force.

2. **The equation of motion**: The change of momentum of a body equals the net force acting on it.

3. **The law of action and reaction**: For every force acting on a body, there is an equal and opposite reactive force.

The **first law** corresponds to the conservation of momentum. The idea here is that an object with no forces acting on it will be at rest or moving at a constant velocity. It is important to note that the first law requires that you define an appropriate inertial frame (a frame of reference). Your inertial frame can be static (at rest) or in motion (with constant velocity, no acceleration). If your reference frame is accelerating, we call that a non-inertial frame and the physics is a bit different. We will discuss non-inertial frames in [Chapters 4](#ch-4) and 5.

The **second law** corresponds to the rate of change of momentum, $\vec{p}$ . The net force acting on a system is:

$$
\sum \vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}
$$ (eq-2-1)

where the momentum is $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$. If your system has *constant mass*, then the second law can be written as:

$$
\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a} = m\ddot{\vec{r}}
$$ (eq-2-2)

See [Chapter 1](#ch-1) for a review of vector notation.

The second law connects kinematics (changes in momentum or the acceleration of an object) to a dynamical force. In the case of a constant mass, Equation (2.1) has the more familiar form of Equation (2.2). However, there can be physics problems where the mass of the system is also allowed to change (e.g., if you are in a rocket that is using fuel). In these cases, you *cannot* use the more familiar $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$ equation. We will discuss variable mass problems in [Chapter 6](#ch-6).

Finally, the **third law** says that forces come in pairs. For two objects that are exerting forces on each other, those forces will be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. That is,

$$
\vec{F}_{12}= -\vec{F}_{21}
$$ (eq-2-3)

For example, when you stand on the ground, you push downward on the surface due to gravity. But you don’t fall into the surface, because the ground pushes back up on you in an equal and opposite force, typically called the normal force.

::::{admonition} Limitations of Newton’s Laws

For most “everyday life physics”, Newtonian mechanics applies just fine. Nevertheless, there are cases where Newtonian mechanics breaks down because the assumption of

absolute space or an absolute time is not quite correct. For example, in special relativity, objects moving close to the speed of light do not behave the same way as objects that are moving at much slower speeds. In general relativity, space and time are warped by mass, an effect that cannot be fully explained by Newtonian mechanics. A great example of this is the shape of Mercury’s orbit (it is not elliptical but rosette shaped).

## 2.3 Static Systems

Static systems are systems that are not in motion. In this case, the sum of all forces $(\sum \vec{F}$ ) and the sum of all momenta $(\sum \vec{p}$ ) are both zero. Let’s look at a problem for a static system.

(example-2-1)=

::::{admonition} Sample Problem 2-1

[Figure 2.1](#fig-2-1) shows two masses connected to each other by an ideal pulley. If this system is at rest, **what is the magnitude of the force of friction?**

:label: fig-2-1
:enumerator: 2.1
:alt: Figure shows an incline with two masses and a pulley connecting them.
:width: 248px

Two masses are attached to an ideal string that runs along the ideal pulley at the edge of an incline of angle $\theta$. One mass sits on the incline and the other hangs off the edge of the incline. The incline has a coefficient of friction, $\mu$. The system is at rest.
:::

**Solution**

First, we find all the forces acting on the system. Since there are two masses, they will each have gravity $M_{1}g$ and $M_{2}g. M_{1}$ is sitting on the incline, so it is pushing down on the incline due to gravity and the incline is pushing up on $M_{1}$ via the normal force $N$. Since $M_{2}$ is hanging, it does not have a normal force. Both masses are attached by a string so that means there is a tension $T$ for both. Since the string and pulley are *ideal*, they have no mass or friction. But there is a coefficient of friction acting on $M_{1}$ from the incline and the friction force is $f = \mu N$, where $N$ is the normal force.

::::

<!-- Source PDF page 41; printed label 32. -->

With the forces, let’s draw the free-body diagram. For simplicity, we’ll split up $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ into two different panels. The left panel in [Figure 2.2](#fig-2-2) shows the free-body diagram for $M_{1}$ on the incline and the right panel is the free-body diagram for $M_{2}$.

:::

[Figure 2.2](#fig-2-2) shows the directions for all the forces, where gravity points down, the normal force is perpendicular to the incline, tension is along the string, and friction is parallel to the surface. Note that we need to assume a direction for friction. The actual direction of friction will depend on the relative masses for $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ (we do not know if $M_{1}$ wants to slide up or down the incline at this time). So we will make a guess for the direction of friction for now. If we guessed wrong, we will just get a negative force.

::::{tip} Quick Question

1. If you remove $M_{2}$, will $M_{1}$ necessarily slide down the ramp?

::::

To find the net force on the system, we sum all forces for both masses. Since the string is ideal, it does not stretch or deform, which means that the tension on both sides of the pulley must be the same and $T_{1}= T_{2}$.

For $M_{2}$, there are only two forces, $T_{2}$ and $M_{2}g$. Since both masses are at rest, the sum of all forces on $M_{2}$ must equal zero (Second Law). So we get $T_{2}= M_{2}g$.

Combining $T_{1}= T_{2}$ and $T_{2}= M_{2}g$, we can revisit the free-body diagram of $M_{1}$. [Figure 2.3](#fig-2-3) is an updated free-body diagram of $M_{1}$ only.

::::{admonition} Continued

With [Figure 2.3](#fig-2-3), we can solve for the normal force $N$ and friction $f$. We break up the gravitational force into the component that is parallel to the incline and perpendicular to the incline. We can get these from trigonometry (see the right panel of [Figure 2.3](#fig-2-3)):

$$
F_{g,//}= -M_{1}g\sin \theta
$$

$$
F_{g,\perp}= -M_{1}g\cos \theta
$$

Note that we have defined up the incline and outward from the incline as positive.

For the system to be at rest, the sum of all forces must be zero. Since the components parallel to the incline $(f,F_{g,//},T_{1})$ are orthogonal to the components perpendicular to the incline $(N,F_{g,\perp})$, they must each add to zero. That is, the sum of all parallel components must be zero and the sum of all perpendicular components must be zero. The two groups of forces act independently. Adding the individual forces in each group:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 &= \sum F_{\perp} \\
0 &= \sum F_{//}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 &= N - M_{1}g\cos \theta \\
0 &= M_{2}g - M_{1}g\sin \theta - f
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
N &= M_{1}g\cos \theta \\
f &= M_{2}g - M_{1}g\sin \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, we have our magnitude of $f$. The true direction of $f$ will depend on $\theta, M_{1}$, and $M_{2}$. If $M_{2}g > M_{1}g\sin \theta$, then $f$ is positive and our assumed direction for $f$ is correct. If $M_{2}g < M_{1}g\sin \theta$, then $f$ will be negative, indicating that our assumed direction for $f$ was wrong. This case means that $M_{1}$ is so heavy that it will pull on $M_{2}$ (e.g., $M_{1}$ wants to move down the incline so friction is acting up the incline) .

1. If $M_{2}$ and $\theta$ are held constant, what is the maximum mass for $M_{1}$ before our assumed direction of friction from [Figure 2.2](#fig-2-2) is wrong?

2. Recall that friction is defined by $f = \mu N$, where $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction. If $M_{1}= M_{2}$ and the angle is $30^{\circ}$, what is the value of $\mu$?

::::{admonition} Lance’s Thoughts

There’s no rule about which axes to use when solving a problem or which direction is positive. Often, the standard $x-y$ (or $x-y-z)$ axes will make your math harder than it needs to be. Look at the problem and decide what makes the most sense to you and align your coordinate system to maximum advantage.

Things to think about: consider how the system is moving and align the coordinates to best fit that motion, including which directions are most convenient to make positive. If the motion is circular or along a curve, polar coordinates might be a better choice than Cartesian. Whatever choices you make, stick with them through your solution.

[Figure 2.1](#fig-2-1) shows an ideal pulley system. When you have an ideal pulley system, it means that the pulley and rope extending over the pulley each have no mass and there is no friction between them. It also means that the rope will not deform (e.g., stretch) due to tension. So you can assume that the tension is the same everywhere in the rope.

An Atwood machine is an ideal pulley system with masses attached by an ideal rope that hang from an ideal pulley. [Figure 2.4](#fig-2-4) shows an example single Atwood machine (left image) and a double Atwood machine (right image). For the single Atwood machine, a single rope holds two masses, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, over an ideal pulley. The double Atwood machine has two ideal ropes: one connecting $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ and a second connecting $M$ to the lower pulley.

The single Atwood machine has one rope (connecting $M_{1}$ and $M_{2})$, whereas the double Atwood machine has a lower rope connecting $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ and an upper rope connecting $M$ and the lower pulley.
:::

Since ideal pulleys have no mass, they will have no net force acting on them (Newton’s second law). That condition makes them useful when equating forces to solve problems. Consider the free-body diagrams for the mass and pulley systems above. Whichever forces act on the pulleys will have to balance to zero.

::::{admonition} Lance’s Thoughts

The key to free-body diagrams (FBDs) for Atwood machines is to remember that every mass and every pulley needs one. If you’re working with ideal pulleys, the FBDs for those will give you the ratios of the tensions in your system and having those will make your life a lot easier. Remember that for ideal ropes the tension is equal everywhere on the same rope and the sum of forces on the pulley is zero. Things get a little more complicated if the pulleys have mass, but drawing the FBD will still help you.

## 2.4 Systems with Constant Acceleration

The simplest case for Newton’s laws is a system with constant acceleration and constant mass such that the net force is also constant $(\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$ = constant).

(example-2-2)=

::::{admonition} Sample Problem 2-2

A person of height $r_{0}$ throws a ball at an angle of $\theta$ upwards from the ground with an initial speed of $v_{0}$. **What is the maximum height that the ball reaches? How** **far does the ball travel horizontally when it hits the ground?**

:::{figure} ../images/figures/figure-2-5.png

:alt: Sketch of projectile motion with ball released at an initial velocity, height, and angle.
:width: 248px

Sketch of the ball’s trajectory. The ball starts at point A, rises up to a maximum at point B, and then hits the ground at point C a distance $x_{C}$ from the original starting point.
:::

**Solution**

We will assume that the ball stays close to the ground such that we can approximate gravity as a constant force (we revisit gravity as a non-constant force in [Chapter 10](#ch-10)).

First, consider how the ball will move. Since the ball is given both a vertical and horizontal initial motion, this is a 2D problem. But the only source of acceleration is from gravity, which is constant and points downwards (gravity does not affect the horizontal motion).

Therefore, the ball will make an arc, with its vertical motion changing (due to the acceleration with gravity) and its horizontal motion held constant (we will ignore any air resistance). The motion along $x$ and $y$ is independent, so we can solve this problem by looking at each component separately.

1. **What is the maximum height?** This is point B in [Figure 2.5](#fig-2-5). The maximum height depends only on the motion along the $y-$axis, so we can ignore motion on the $x-$axis. For the $y-$axis motion, we have an acceleration of $a = -g$, defining up as positive. Since $a = \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}$ , we can integrate to get the equation for velocity as a function of time. See also, [Chapter 1](#ch-1) for more details.

::::

<!-- Source PDF page 45; printed label 36. -->

$v_{y} = \int a\,\mathrm{d}t$. Since $a = -g$ is constant, $v_{y} = -gt + C$, where $C$ is the initial velocity along the $y$-axis. That initial velocity is $v_{0}\sin\theta$, so $v_{y} = -gt + v_{0}\sin\theta$ (see [Figure 2.5](#fig-2-5)).

For height, $y = \int v_{y}$d$t$. Integrating the velocity equation gives,

$$
y = r_{0}+ v_{0}\sin \theta t - \frac{1}{2} gt^{2}=\Rightarrow r_{0}\mathrm{is} \mathrm{the} \mathrm{initial} \mathrm{height} \mathrm{of} \mathrm{the} \mathrm{ball}
$$

To find the maximum height, $y_{B}$, we need the time when the ball reaches the peak of motion, $t_{B}$. At the peak, the vertical component of the velocity will be instantaneously zero.

0 = $-gt_{B}+ v_{0}\sin \theta =\Rightarrow$ at the peak of motion, $v_{y}$ = 0

$$
t_{B}= \frac{v_{0}\sin \theta}{g}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{B}
&= -\frac{1}{2}gt_{B}^{2}+(v_{0}\sin\theta)t_{B}+r_{0} \\
&= -\frac{1}{2}g\left(\frac{v_{0}\sin\theta}{g}\right)^{2}
 +(v_{0}\sin\theta)\left(\frac{v_{0}\sin\theta}{g}\right)+r_{0} \\
&= -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{v_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta}{g}\right)
 +\left(\frac{v_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta}{g}\right)+r_{0} \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{v_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta}{g}\right)+r_{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that this equation has the same form as the 1-D case (see Example 1-1), but with a $\sin \theta$ term. If $\theta = 90^{\circ}$, then the ball is being thrown straight up and we recover the 1-D case exactly, as we should. So the 2-D equation is a more generic form of how the ball moves, whereas the 1-D situation is a specific case.

2. **How far does the ball travel horizontally when it hits the ground?** Unlike the vertical motion, the horizontal motion does not have an acceleration. So the horizontal component of the motion remains constant throughout the ball’s travels. The horizontal component of the motion is given by $v_{x}= v_{0}\cos \theta$. Assuming that the ball starts at $x$ = 0, we want to calculate the position it has traveled after time $t_{C}$. That distance is simply given by $x_{C}= v_{x}t_{C}$, because the ball starts at $x$ = 0 (definition) and $a_{x}$ = 0. That means we need to know how long the ball was in the air to know how far it traveled horizontally.

<!-- Source PDF page 46; printed label 37. -->

::::{admonition} Continued

To get the length of time that the ball was in the air, we need to solve for the time when $y$ = 0 because the ball has hit the ground (see Example 1-1). The height at point C is given by,

$$
y_{C}= - \frac{1}{2} gt^{2}_{C}+ (v_{0}\sin \theta)t_{C}+ r_{0}= 0
$$

which is a quadratic equation with a solution of:

$$
t_{C}=\frac{v_{0}\sin\theta\pm\sqrt{v_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta+2gr_{0}}}{g}
$$

There are two solutions, one that gives a positive time and one that gives a negative time. Only the positive case is correct given the motion of the ball as defined by the problem (see Example 1-1 for more information on why we reject the negative case). Thus, the time necessary to hit the ground is:

$$
t_{C}=\frac{v_{0}\sin\theta+\sqrt{v_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta+2gr_{0}}}{g}
$$

And the horizontal distance traveled by the ball in that time is:

$$
x_{C}=v_{x}t_{C}
=v_{0}\cos\theta\left[
\frac{v_{0}\sin\theta+\sqrt{v_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta+2gr_{0}}}{g}
\right]
$$

Note, if $\theta = 90^{\circ}$ (ball is thrown straight up), then we get $x_{C}$ = 0 as expected. For $\theta = 90^{\circ}$, there is no horizontal motion, and we recover the 1-D case where the ball travels only with vertical motion.

1. Give the maximum height and horizontal distance in the $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ case. Describe the trajectory of the motion.

2. What is the direction and magnitude of the velocity vector at point B and point C in [Figure 2.5](#fig-2-5)?

3. How would the maximum height and the horizontal distance change if you were to throw the ball from the surface of the Moon (with 1/6th the force of gravity) compared to Earth?

<!-- Source PDF page 47; printed label 38. -->

::::{admonition} Real World Applications

We tend to treat gravity as a constant acceleration near the surface of the Earth, but in practice drag forces from the air can still cause objects to fall at different rates. During the Apollo 15 mission to the Moon in 1971, astronauts dropped a hammer and a feather and showed that they fell at the same time. This experiment demonstrated that gravity can indeed be considered a constant in the complete absence of atmospheric drag. See the [Apollo 15 Hammer-Feather Drop video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYEgdZ3iEKA).

Refer to the trajectories shown in the adjacent figure.
With a low initial velocity, a projectile will arc and hit the ground a short distance away (case A). As you increase the velocity, the projectile arcs more and hits further away such that the curvature of the Earth becomes a factor (cases B and C). At high enough speeds, the Earth curves under the projectile at the same rate that its trajectory curves. Basically, gravity changes the direction of motion as the Earth’s surface curves away. When this happens, the projectile is in a circular orbit (case D) or elliptical orbit (cases E and F).

How fast do you need to go? The Earth’s surface curves down $\sim 5$ m every $\sim 8$ km. At an acceleration of 9.8 m $\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, an object will drop 5 m in $\sim 1$ s. So the projectile must travel about 8 km in 1 s to maintain a constant height over the Earth. A speed of 8 km/s is about 29,000 km/h, which is also about the speed of low-Earth orbit satellites and the International Space Station. So low-Earth orbit satellites are falling back to Earth at the same rate as the Earth curves.

## 2.5 Systems with Varying Acceleration

Now consider cases where the acceleration is not constant. As a result, the force will also vary with time, $F = F(t)$. We will consider how these forces affect the motion of a system.

<!-- Source PDF page 48; printed label 39. -->

(sec-2-5-1)=
### 2.5.1 Exponential Force

Consider a force that is changing exponentially with time. You can get exponential forces in some cases of drag and damping (e.g., in the critical case). Let us assume there is one force and it has a form of $F = m\alpha e^{-\beta t}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive constants, and $m$ is the mass of the system. Note that this is our net force such that $F = ma = m\alpha e^{-\beta t}$, so $a = \alpha e^{-\beta t}$. For the equation to be dimensionally consistent with $a$, the units of $\alpha$ are [m $\mathrm{s}^{-2}]$ and the units of $\beta$ are $[\mathrm{s}^{-1}]$. **Find the equations for** $x(t)$ **and** $v(t)$ **assuming that the system** **has** $v = v_{0}$ **and** $x$ = 0 **at** $t$ = 0**.**

To solve this problem, we use $\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}=a$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}=v$. Starting with $a$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} &= a \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \alpha e^{-\beta t}=\Rightarrow \mathrm{sub} \mathrm{in} \mathrm{our} \mathrm{equation} \mathrm{for} a \\
\mathrm{d}v &= \alpha e^{-\beta t}\mathrm{d}t \\
\int \mathrm{d}v &= \int \alpha e^{-\beta t}\mathrm{d}t \\
v &= - \frac{\alpha}{\beta} e^{-\beta t}+ C =\Rightarrow \mathrm{where} C \mathrm{is} \mathrm{a} \mathrm{constant} \mathrm{of} \mathrm{integration}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can solve for $C$ using the initial conditions that $v = v_{0}$ at $t$ = 0.

$$
\begin{aligned}
C &= v + \frac{\alpha}{\beta} e^{-\beta t} \\
C &= v_{0}+ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} =\Rightarrow \mathrm{set} v = v_{0}\mathrm{at} t = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Subbing $C$ into our velocity equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= - \frac{\alpha}{\beta} e^{-\beta t}+ v_{0}+ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \\
v &= v_{0}+ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \Big(1 - e^{-\beta t}\Big)
\end{aligned}
$$

::::{admonition} Definite VS the Indefinite Integral

The example above uses an *indefinite* integral, which is where you do not include limits on the integral. With this approach, you end up with a constant of integration and you need to apply the initial conditions to solve for it. The *definite* integral is where you put limits on the integral and solve the problem without the need for a constant. For the above problem, the definite integral would be:

$$
\int_{v_{0}}^{V} \mathrm{d}v = \int_{0}^{\tau} \alpha e^{-\beta t}\mathrm{d}t
$$

where $V$ and $\tau$ are dummy variables to represent the velocity at a later time (we use dummy variables to avoid overlap with $v$ and $t$ in the integrand). Note that the definite

::::

<!-- Source PDF page 49; printed label 40. -->

::::{admonition} Continued

integral contains the initial conditions (in the lower bounds), so solving this equation will give you the full equation for velocity without needing to solve for a constant of integration. We will show examples of *both* cases in this textbook. See the [online repository](https://github.com/OSTP/dynamicsTextbook/blob/main/video_links.md) for a video that directly compares these cases.

::::

Let’s look at some limits. **First, what happens as** $t \rightarrow$ 0**?** This is not the same as $t$ = 0. Basically, we want $t$ to be very small, but not quite zero yet. When $t \rightarrow$ 0, the exponential can be simplified by its Taylor series (see [Chapter 1](#ch-1) and [Appendix B](#app-b)). Using the approximation that $e^{x}\approx 1 + x$ for small values of $x$, we get,

$$
v = v_{0}+ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \Big(1 - e^{-\beta t}\Big) \approx v_{0}+ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} [1 - (1 - \beta t)] \approx v_{0}+ \alpha t
$$

This makes sense, because at early times (small $t)$, the force is $F(t) = m\alpha e^{-\beta t}\approx m\alpha$, which means that the force and the acceleration are close to being constant. If you have a constant acceleration, your velocity is just a linear function with time.

**What happens as** $t \rightarrow \infty$ **(so** $t$ **is very big)?** As $t$ becomes very large, the exponential term goes to zero. With this condition, we have

$$
v = v_{0}+ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \Big(1 - e^{-\beta t}\Big) \approx v_{0}+ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} = \mathrm{constant}
$$

So at very large times, the velocity approaches a constant. This makes sense, because as $t$ becomes very large, the force and acceleration both approach zero, $F(t) = m\alpha e^{-\beta t}\approx 0$. If you have no acceleration, then you have a constant velocity.

Finally, let’s solve for the position, $x$ using the *definite* integral:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} &= v \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} &= v_{0}+ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \Big(1 - e^{-\beta t}\Big) =\Rightarrow \mathrm{sub} \mathrm{in} \mathrm{our} \mathrm{equation} \mathrm{for} v \\
\mathrm{d}x &= v_{0}\mathrm{d}t + \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \Big(1 - e^{-\beta t}\Big)\mathrm{d}t
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{X}\mathrm{d}x
&= \int_{0}^{\tau}\left(v_{0}+\frac{\alpha}{\beta}
 -\frac{\alpha}{\beta}e^{-\beta t}\right)\mathrm{d}t \\
\left.x\right|_{0}^{X}
&= \left.v_{0}t+\frac{\alpha}{\beta}t
 +\frac{\alpha}{\beta^{2}}e^{-\beta t}\right|_{0}^{\tau} \\
X
&= v_{0}\tau+\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\tau
 +\frac{\alpha}{\beta^{2}}e^{-\beta\tau}-\frac{\alpha}{\beta^{2}} \\
x
&= v_{0}t+\frac{\alpha}{\beta}t
 +\frac{\alpha}{\beta^{2}}e^{-\beta t}-\frac{\alpha}{\beta^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

In the above example, we use $X$ and $\tau$ to represent the position at some unknown time. They are just representative variables for position and time to avoid confusion and can be swapped out with the generic $x$ and $t$ at the end.

<!-- Source PDF page 50; printed label 41. -->

**Let’s look at the limiting case of** $x$ **as** $t \rightarrow$ 0**.** We will again use the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function. This time, however, we need three terms rather than just two terms. When $t$ is very small, $x(t)$ becomes:

$$
x = v_{0}t + \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \Bigg(t + \frac{1}{\beta} e^{-\beta t}- \frac{1}{\beta} \Bigg) \approx v_{0}t + \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \Bigg(t + \frac{1}{\beta} \bigg[1 - \beta t + \frac{1}{2} \beta ^{2}t^{2}\bigg] - \frac{1}{\beta} \Bigg)
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
&= v_{0}t + \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \Bigg(t + \frac{1}{\beta} - t + \frac{1}{2} \beta t^{2}- \frac{1}{\beta} \Bigg) \\
&= v_{0}t + \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \bigg(\frac{1}{2} \beta t^{2}\bigg) \\
&= v_{0}t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

So when $t$ is very small, our equation for position goes as $x \approx v_{0}t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^{2}$, which is the equation you would get for constant acceleration. This also makes sense, because at very early times, the acceleration is roughly constant.

::::{tip} Quick Questions

1. In the previous case (solving for $x$ at early times), we had to take the first three terms in the Taylor series approximation of the exponential. What happens if we only take the first or first two terms? Why did we need three terms?

2. Why don’t we consider the position as $t \rightarrow \infty$ (becomes very large)? What would happen to an object in this case?

### 2.5.2 Force is Proportional to Velocity

Consider a force that is proportional to the velocity of the system. Examples of such forces are the magnetic force (magnitude is proportional to velocity, although in a vector cross product), viscous friction of a body in a fluid, and drag forces.

Consider a force, $F(v)$ acting on a particle with the magnitude of $F(v) = -m\alpha v$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $\alpha$ is a positive constant, and $v$ is the velocity of the particle. Assume that the system moves only in 1-D (along $x)$ and that $v = v_{0}$ and $x$ = 0 at $t$ = 0. **Find the equations for** $x(t)$ **and** $v(t)$ **for this particle**.

Let’s start with $v(t)$. Starting from the Second Law, we have $F = ma = -m\alpha v$. Thus, we get that $a = -\alpha v$ or

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\alpha v
$$

What we have now is a differential equation. The time derivative of $v$ depends on $v$ itself. This differential equation has a simple solution, fortunately. We must re-arrange the equation by moving the $v$ to the left side of the equation and the d$t$ to the right side of the

<!-- Source PDF page 51; printed label 42. -->

equation. We can now easily integrate both sides to solve this problem.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{v} &= -\alpha \mathrm{d}t =\Rightarrow \mathrm{using} \mathrm{dummy} \mathrm{variables} \mathrm{because} \mathrm{we}\text{’}\mathrm{re} \mathrm{solving} \mathrm{for} v \mathrm{at} t \\
\int_{v_{0}}^{V} \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{v} &= -\alpha \int_{0}^{\tau} \mathrm{d}t =\Rightarrow v = v_{0}\mathrm{at} t = 0, V \mathrm{and} \tau \mathrm{are} \mathrm{dummy} \mathrm{variables} \\
\left[\ln v\right]_{v_{0}}^{V} &= -\alpha (\tau - 0)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln V-\ln v_{0}&=-\alpha\tau \\
\ln\left(\frac{V}{v_{0}}\right)&=-\alpha\tau \\
\frac{V}{v_{0}}&=e^{-\alpha\tau} \\
v&=v_{0}e^{-\alpha t}
\end{aligned}
$$

1. What is the velocity as $t \rightarrow$ 0 and $t \rightarrow \infty$? Do these values make sense?

2. Find the equation for the acceleration of the particle and the units for any constants. What is the acceleration as $t \rightarrow$ 0 and $t \rightarrow \infty$?

What about $x$? Well, we can use our equation for $v$ and the condition of $x$ = 0 at $t$ = 0:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}&=v \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t}&=v_{0}e^{-\alpha t} \\
\mathrm{d}x&=v_{0}e^{-\alpha t}\,\mathrm{d}t \\
\int\mathrm{d}x&=\int v_{0}e^{-\alpha t}\,\mathrm{d}t \\
x&=-\frac{v_{0}}{\alpha}e^{-\alpha t}+C \\
x&=-\frac{v_{0}}{\alpha}e^{-\alpha t}+\frac{v_{0}}{\alpha} \\
x&=\frac{v_{0}}{\alpha}\left(1-e^{-\alpha t}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

There are other ways that force can be proportional to velocity. Let’s look at an example of a viscous force.

<!-- Source PDF page 52; printed label 43. -->

(example-2-3)=

::::{admonition} Sample Problem 2-3

A metal block of mass $m$ slides on a horizontal surface that has a layer of heavy oil so that the block experiences a viscous force that varies as the $3/2$ power of the speed, that is, $F(v) = -bmv^{3/2}$; here $b$ is a positive constant. Let the initial speed of the block be $v_{0}$ at $x$ = 0. **What is the equation of maximum distance that the block will** **travel before it comes to rest in terms of** $m, v_{0}$**, and** $b$**?**

:alt: A cartoon showing a block moving on layer of oil with its free-body diagram.
:width: 248px

Block of mass $m$ slides forward in an oil slick, experiencing $F(v)$, the viscous force $F_{v}$. The gravitational force is $F_{g}$ and the normal force is $F_{N}$.
:::

**Solution**

Looking at the above diagram, and knowing intuitively that the metal block does not leave the horizontal surface, the vertical y-component forces can be ignored as $F_{g}= F_{N}$ (the gravitational force equals the normal force). So the only forces that matter are in the horizontal direction.

The block starts with a velocity $v_{0}$ and the viscous force acts to slow it down (the block has negative acceleration). When the block reaches its maximum displacement, then $v$ = 0 (e.g., if the block is still moving forward, then it has not reached its maximum distance yet).

If we apply Newton’s second law (Equation 2.1) to the viscous force given, then we obtain a differential equation of motion:

$$
ma = F(v)
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
m \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} &= -bmv^{3/2} \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} &= -bv^{3/2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since we are trying to solve for the maximum distance (when $v$ = 0), we could solve the problem by getting $v(t)$ and then $x(t)$ using all the initial conditions, find the time when the velocity goes to zero, and then get $x$ at that time. But a faster way to solve this problem is to get $v(x)$. We can do this using the *chain rule*, where

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}x} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = v \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}x}.
$$

::::

<!-- Source PDF page 53; printed label 44. -->

::::{admonition} Continued

A way to think of the chain rule for derivatives is to think in terms of finite changes in a function like $\Delta x$. That is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \\
a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta x} =\Rightarrow \mathrm{note} \mathrm{that} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta x} = 1 \\
a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta x} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} =\Rightarrow \mathrm{rearrange} \mathrm{the} \mathrm{terms} \\
a &= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta x} v =\Rightarrow \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = v \\
\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} &= v \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta x} \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t} &= v \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}x} =\Rightarrow \mathrm{in} \mathrm{the} \mathrm{limit} \mathrm{where} \Delta t \rightarrow 0
\end{aligned}
$$

The chain rule simplifies the math needed to solve the problem. Tricks like this are helpful to more efficiently tackle physics problems. It may not be intuitive to you yet, but the more you practice using this trick, the more you will be able to know when to apply it.

Using the chain rule, we can get the equation of motion in terms of $v(x)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}x} &= -bv^{3/2} \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}x} &= -bv^{1/2}=\Rightarrow \mathrm{simplify} \\
v^{-1/2}\mathrm{d}v &= -b\mathrm{d}x =\Rightarrow \mathrm{rearrange}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we can integrate both sides. In this case, we consider $v$ at different positions $x$. At $t$ = 0 we are told that $x$ = 0 and $v = v_{0}$ in the problem. At our maximum distance, $x_{\max}$, the block stops moving, so $v$ = 0. So we can solve this differential equation using these limits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{v_{0}}^{0} v^{-1/2}\mathrm{d}v &= \int_{0}^{x_{\max}} -b\mathrm{d}x \\
\left[2v^{1/2}\right]_{v_{0}}^{0} &= -b\left[x\right]_{0}^{x_{\max}} \\
2(0 - v_{0}^{1/2}) &= -b(x_{\max}- 0)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
x_{\max}=\frac{2}{b}\sqrt{v_{0}}
$$

You will get the same answer if you solve for $v(t), x(t)$, and the time $t_{\max}$ when $v$ = 0 to then find the position $x(t_{\max})$. Try it out and compare the time and number of steps.

## 2.6 Real-World Application

Drag is often considered a problem in design, but it has many constructive uses as well. One of the most obvious ways to see a drag force in action is by considering a parachute. In the case of a skydiver, the parachute opens behind/above them and creates a much larger surface area perpendicular to the motion, increasing the drag force to counter most of the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity, and lowering the diver’s terminal velocity enough to allow the parachutist to reach the ground with only a mild impact.

Parachutes are used for other purposes as well, like slowing a race car down quickly after it hits the finish line in a short-track race, increasing resistance for a runner trying to build strength, and landing a space capsule for retrieval or planetary exploration.

**For more information:** For demonstrations of the drag force in action to slow down short track race cars, check out [this video, courtesy of the National Hot Rod Association.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEjLviWTuXU)

## 2.7 Summary

::::{admonition} Key Takeaways

This section is about Newton’s three laws and their application to solve physics problems. The key laws covered in this section are the second law,

$$
\sum \vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}
$$

and the third law,

$$
\vec{F}_{12}= -\vec{F}_{21}
$$

When a system has constant mass, the second law can be written as,

$$
\sum \vec{F} = m\vec{a} = m \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}
$$

Newton’s laws can be used to solve for the equations of motion, by integrating the acceleration to get velocity and then integrating the velocity to get position. It is important to consider how the acceleration of the system (or net force) varies with time prior to applying the integration.

To help you solve the equations of motion:

1. draw a free-body diagram

2. ensure that you know how the system is moving

3. consider the initial conditions

before attempting any problems.
